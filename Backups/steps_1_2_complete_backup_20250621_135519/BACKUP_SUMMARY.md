# Steps 1-2 Complete Backup - Strict Contact Force Penalties

## Status: WORKING ✅
- All tensor shape issues resolved
- Environment creates successfully with 13 active reward terms
- Phase-aware contact penalties working correctly

## Files Included:
1. `force_variable_impedance_env_cfg.py` - Main environment configuration
2. `simple_strict_contact_mdp.py` - Working MDP functions for contact penalties
3. `strict_contact_mdp.py` - Original reference implementation
4. `test_strict_contact_force_penalties.py` - Test script for validation

## Completed Features:
### Step 1: Phase-Aware Contact Penalties ✅
- Approach phase: -25.0 weight, 5.0N threshold
- Grasp phase: -15.0 weight, 10.0N threshold  
- Manipulation phase: -8.0 weight, 15.0N threshold

### Step 2: Enhanced Force Variable Impedance ✅
- Reduced controller stiffness (150N/m)
- Added strict force limits (15N max)
- Extended curriculum learning durations
- Contact sensor properly configured

## Next Steps (Pending):
3. Non-grasp contact penalties
4. Smooth approach rewards  
5. Anti-dragging penalties

## Key Technical Solutions:
- Fixed tensor shapes: `torch.sum(net_forces, dim=1)` → `torch.norm(force_vector, dim=1)`
- Proper environment count handling with padding/truncation
- Simple direct force vector access approach

## Usage:
```bash
cd /home/amitabh/IsaacLab
python test_strict_contact_force_penalties.py
```
